## My process
- First, I started by analyzing the structure of the project and see how it should be displayed on desktop and mobile.
- Then, I started creating the HTML skeleton of the project.
- As I chose to use CSS grid, I first made the structure of the boxes just like the final project before adding any content.
- I added the content and then started to style it .
- Finally, I added the media query for mobile display and I checked the responsiveness of the design.

### Built with

This project was build with HTML and CSS using the manipulation of CSS grid.


### What I learned

Since this was the first time I have manipulated CSS grid, I have learned most of the fundamentals.
I also learned how to make and style a background image.

### Continued development

With this project, It is safe to say that I have the basics of HTML & CSS. So I am aiming to do a project
that contains JavaScript problems especially the DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation.

### Useful resources

- Google : I googled the solutions of the problems I had and I got a lot of helping answers mostly from StackOverFlow.
- This is a very helpful tutorial on how to deal with background images : https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-background-image-with-html-example-code/.
